1. Deciding Between `<article>`, `<section>`, or `<div>` Elements

At times it becomes fairly difficult to decide which element—`<article>`, `<section>`, or `<div>`—is the best element for the job based on its semantic meaning. The trick here, as with every semantic decision, is to look at the content.

Both the `<article>` and `<section>` elements contribute to a document’s structure and help to outline a document. If the content is being grouped solely for styling purposes and doesn’t provide value to the outline of a document, use the `<div>` element.

If the content adds to the document outline and it can be independently redistributed or syndicated, use the `<article>` element.

If the content adds to the document outline and represents a thematic group of content, use the `<section>` element.
